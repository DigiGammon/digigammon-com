I would like to express my strongest support for Digigammon, that can resolve a time-consuming, annoying challenge: manual transcription. To transcribe a match manually takes roughly the same time as playing the match. The human labor hours saved by Digigammon will be tens of thousands every year.
Marc Brockmann Olsen, CEO of Backgammon Galaxy

It was a great experience to test out NEAR REAL-TIME AUTOMATIC transcription software provided by DIGIGAMMON. The transcription of our 7pt-match with Jurgen took only 3 minutes.
Michihito Kageyama

So looking forward to the project really think it will help the backgammon so much
Sebastiaan Kuijs

Best of luck Team DG in making this happen; This will be a huge success and a big time saver for sure at all the tournaments.
Stephen Soukup

Such a cool product! This is truly amazing!
Jeroen Dutch



I tested at Merit Park. The program is amazing, the Team is outstanding. That is for sure a clear TAKE. Canâ€˜t wait for a chance to get this tool.
Michael Weidner

Great innovative product. You will have little problem selling to just about every BG player. Well done.
